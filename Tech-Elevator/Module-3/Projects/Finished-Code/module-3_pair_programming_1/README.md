# Week 9 Pair Exercises: Tech Elevator Popsicles

## Context

Tech Elevator has decided to expand into the popsicle business and has asked you to create their homepage and a contact form. The design team has created mockups of the homepage and contact form, both in desktop and mobile formats.

Before you start, be sure to review the provided CSS for what styling rules have already been defined, and look at the mockups below.

## Desktop layouts

## Mobile layouts

## Requirements

* Use semantic HTML
* Use CSS Grid for the main layout
* Use CSS ID/class selectors and combinators
* Apply an effect to hyperlinks when the mouse is over it

## Notes and tips

* The mobile breakpoint can be 800px since a separate tablet layout isn't required.
* Make sure your final design is as close to the mockups as possible—note the margins, paddings, heights, and widths.
  * If you're off by a pixel or two, that's fine, but your finished product should closely resemble the mockups.
* The starting code in `styles.css` is meant to help you get started—take advantage of it.
* It might be helpful to use Grid or Flexbox to align elements within sections.
