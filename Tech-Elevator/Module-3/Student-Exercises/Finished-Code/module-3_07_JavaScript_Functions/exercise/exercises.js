 * Write and document a function called getSumOfSubArrayValues.
 *
 * Take an array of arrays, adds up all sub values, and returns

 * [
 *   [1, 2, 3],
 *   [2, 4, 6],
 *   [5, 10, 15]
 * ];
 *
 * The function returns 48. To do this, you will use two nested `reduce`
 * calls with two anonymous functions.
 *
 * Read the tests to verify you have the correct behavior.
