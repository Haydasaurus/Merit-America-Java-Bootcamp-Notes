5. **oddOnly** Write a function that given an array of integer of any length, removes
    the even numbers, and returns a new array of just the the odd numbers.

7. **cigarParty** When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. 
A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive. 
Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. 
Write a squirrel party function that return true if the party with the given values is successful, 
or false otherwise.

		cigarParty(50, false) → true
		cigarParty(70, true) → true

/*
8. **fizzBuzz** Given a number, return a value according to the following rules:
If the number is multiple of 3, return "Fizz."
If the number is a multiple of 5, return "Buzz." 
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, return "FizzBuzz."
In all other cases return the original number.
