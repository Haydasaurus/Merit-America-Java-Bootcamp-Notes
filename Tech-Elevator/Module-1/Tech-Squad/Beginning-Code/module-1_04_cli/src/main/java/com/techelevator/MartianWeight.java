    In case you've ever pondered how much you weight on Mars, here's the calculation:
    Wm = We* 0.378
    where 'Wm' is the weight on Mars, and 'We' is the weight on Earth
    
    Write a command line program which accepts a series of Earth weights as command line arguments,
    and displays each Earth weight as itself, and its Martian equivalent.

    235 lbs.on Earth, is 88 lbs.on Mars.
