# Updating existing rows

Data is often changed in a system—for example, changing your user profile or updating a blog post—so having a way to update data is important. For instance, you can use an `UPDATE` statement to change the name of Honduras to its full, official name:

```sql
UPDATE country SET name = 'The Republic of Honduras'
WHERE code = 'HND';
```

You'll see the familiar `WHERE` clause here, which now selects which rows you want to update.

>**⚠ Warning: Use your WHERE clause on every UPDATE**
>
>If you forget the `WHERE` clause, the update happens on every row in the table, changing all of your data. To make sure that you update the correct rows, write a `SELECT` statement first:
>
>```sql
>SELECT * FROM country
>WHERE code = 'HND';
>```
>
>Once you've verified that it brings back the rows you want, change it to an `UPDATE` statement.

Here's the structure of an `UPDATE` statement:

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
