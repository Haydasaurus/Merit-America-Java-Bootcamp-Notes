# Pulling changes

Whether you're working on separate computers (one at home, one at work) or with different team members, you'll need a way to incorporate the changes that are in the remote repository into your local repository. The `git pull` command instructs git to fetch commits from a remote repository.

The `git pull` command looks like this:
```shell
> git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

>**✔ Tip: Pull before you push**
>
>You can't push your changes to a remote repository if the remote repository has changes that you haven't incorporated into yours yet. When you are one of a team of developers, always do `git pull` before `git push`.

The workflow diagram shown earlier therefore changes a bit in a team environment:
