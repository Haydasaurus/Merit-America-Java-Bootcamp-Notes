# Command-Line Exercises



## Make change

Write a command-line program which prompts the user for the total bill, and the amount tendered. It should then display the change required.

```
Please enter the amount of the bill: 23.65 <br/>
Please enter the amount tendered: 100.00 <br/>
The change required is 76.35

## Martian Weight

In case you've ever pondered how much you weigh on Mars, here's the calculation:

    Wm = We* 0.378

where 'Wm' is the weight on Mars, and 'We' is the weight on Earth

Write a command-line program which accepts a series of Earth weights from the user
and displays each Earth weight as itself, and its Martian equivalent.

```
Enter a series of Earth weights (space-separated): 98 235 185

98 lbs. on Earth is 37 lbs.on Mars.
235 lbs. on Earth is 88 lbs.on Mars.
185 lbs. on Earth is 69 lbs.on Mars.
